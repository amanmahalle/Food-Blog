## Build with 

- `HTML5`

- A little `JavaScript`

## A few other cool features

- Use JS to smoother / slower the scrolling process for scroll-to-top button
- Use JS to handle click toggle menu on mobile

- How to arrange the order of CSS properties in groups for easy control and editing later.
- The principle is always separate layout and content when coding the UI
- How to combine flexibility between Bootstrap Grid and Flexbox to have a beautiful UI and good code
- How to use CSS Properties `transition`, `transform`, `animation` to create a effect for website
- How to use CSS Variables
